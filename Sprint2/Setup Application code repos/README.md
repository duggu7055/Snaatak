## Introduction

The OT-Microservices Project is a modular system designed to streamline organizational tasks using a microservices architecture. It includes the following components: Frontend, employee-api, attendance-api, and salary-api.

---

## Prerequisites

1. A working VCS (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.).
2. Admin or Owner access to your repositories.

---

## Step-By-Step Setup Guide

1. Go to GitHub and log in to your account.
2. Click the `+` icon in the top-right corner and select **New repository**.
3. Fill in the details:
   - **Repository Name**: Examples:
     - [Notification-worker](https://github.com/Team-Downtime-Crew/Notification-worker)
     - [Frontend](https://github.com/Team-Downtime-Crew/frontend)
     - [employee-api](https://github.com/Team-Downtime-Crew/employee-api)
     - [attendance-api](https://github.com/Team-Downtime-Crew/attendance-api)
     - [salary-api](https://github.com/Team-Downtime-Crew/salary-api)
   - **Description**: Add a brief description of the repository.
   - **Visibility**: Choose either **Public** or **Private**.
   - `Check` **Initialize this repository with a README**.
4. Click **Create repository**.

## Decision-Making Process

The choice to use a micro-repository structure for this project was guided by the following factors:

1. **Modularity**:
   - Each repository corresponds to a specific microservice or component, promoting independent development and deployment.
   - Easier to maintain and scale individual services.

2. **Collaboration**:
   - Smaller, focused repositories enable different teams to work on individual components without stepping on each otherâ€™s toes.
   - Clear repository boundaries reduce merge conflicts and improve code review efficiency.

3. **Versioning and Dependency Management**:
   - Independent repositories allow for precise version control and dependency isolation.
   - Changes in one microservice do not inadvertently affect others.

4. **Deployment Pipelines**:
   - Separate repositories align well with CI/CD pipelines, allowing microservices to be built, tested, and deployed independently.

5. **Best Practices**:
   - The micro-repository approach aligns with industry best practices for microservices architecture.

## Conclusion

A well-organized repository structure is key to the success of the OT-Microservices Project. By setting up clear repositories, directories, and version control practices, you enable collaborative and maintainable development.
